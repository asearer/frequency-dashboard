# Frequency Dashboard App

Welcome to the Frequency Dashboard App! I designed this personal project to visualize and analyze radio frequency data, signals, and satellite information. Whether you're a radio enthusiast, a researcher, or just interested in frequency data, this app offers a comprehensive and intuitive interface for monitoring and understanding radio frequencies.

**Note: This app is still very much a work in progress.** I am actively developing and refining features, and your feedback is valuable as I continue to improve the application.

## Features

- **Real-Time Frequency Visualization**: Real-time monitoring and visualization of radio frequencies with interactive charts and graphs.
- **Signal Analysis**: Tools to analyze signal strength, frequency patterns, and signal-to-noise ratios.
- **Satellite Tracking**: Functionality to view and track satellite positions and signal data.
- **Customizable Dashboard**: Tailor your dashboard with widgets and settings to focus on the data that matters most to you.
